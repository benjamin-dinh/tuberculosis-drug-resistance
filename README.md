# **Tuberculosis Drug Resistance**

Team: McKenzie Hochbery, Melissa Jost, Mohammad Ismail Daud, Taimur Kashif, Benjamin Dinh

We built four models to determine thresholds for gene mutation signals that cause drug resistance. We looked at whether certain molecular probes designed to detect specific gene mutations yield high or low signals. Early detection of drug resistance can quicken the process of finding the right drug cocktail to treat TB.

Our four models were:
- Z-Scores
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Logistic Regression

Result: Decision Trees yielded the highest accuract rate of 98%.
